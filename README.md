Inspired on lain-on-WIRED project, I'm aiming to achieve all the prerequisites for an Windows integration.

  Fine, I'm stuck on how I'd call an overlay for it cause I'm still suck on Windows API calls. I don't even think there are native tools for it.
  I hate being stuck as this so, in case I'm stuck until wednesday, I shall make it in C and see what happens.
